 * Helper to easily output a Graph instance to a file.

 * defines two methods to do so: {@link #write(String)} and
 * {@link #write(String, GraphWriter)}. The first one tried to deduce the graph
 * output format from the filename extension (and if it cannot or if there is
 * no extension is uses DGS). The other takes an already create graph writer.
