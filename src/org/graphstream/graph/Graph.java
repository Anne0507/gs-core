/**
 * An Interface that advises general purpose methods for handling graphs.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface is one of the main interfaces of GraphStream. It defines the services
 * provided by a graph structure. Graphs implementations must at least implement
 * this interface (but are free to provide more services). 
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * With {@link org.graphstream.io.Source}, {@link org.graphstream.io.Sink}
 * and {@link org.graphstream.graph.GraphListener}, this interface is one of the
 * most important. A graph is a {@link org.graphstream.io.Pipe} that buffers
 * the graph events an present the graph structure as it is actually.
 * </p> 
 * 
 * <p>
 * In other words, it allows to browse the graph structure, to explore it, to
 * modify it, and to implement algorithms on it.
 * </p>
