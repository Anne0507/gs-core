/**
 * An Interface that advises general purpose methods for handling graphs.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface is one of the main interfaces of GraphStream. It defines the
 * services provided by a graph structure. Graphs implementations must at least
 * implement this interface (but are free to provide more services).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * With {@link org.graphstream.stream.Source},
 * {@link org.graphstream.stream.Sink} and {@link org.graphstream.stream.Pipe},
 * this interface is one of the most important. A graph is a
 * {@link org.graphstream.stream.Pipe} that buffers the graph events and present
 * the graph structure as it is actually.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In other words, it allows to browse the graph structure, to explore it, to
 * modify it, and to implement algorithms on it. This class can be seen as a
 * snapshot of a stream of event at current time.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * With factories ({@link org.graphstream.graph.NodeFactory},
 * {@link org.graphstream.graph.EdgeFactory}), users can define their own models
 * of nodes or edges. Problem is that when you define such model, you want to
 * access to elements with the valid type, without cast if possible. To improve
 * the access to elements in such cases, Graph offers implicit genericity to
 * access nodes or edges. The following is an example of an access without
 * genericity :
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 	Graph g = ... ;
 * 	g.setNodeFactory( new MyNodeFactory() );
 *  g.addNode("root");
 *  
 *  MyNode n = (MyNode) g.getNode("root");
 *  
 *  for( Node o : g.getEachNode() )
 *  {
 *  	MyNode node = (MyNode) o;
 *  	// Do something with node
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * With implicit genericity offers by Graph, this can be done easier:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  Graph g = ... ;
 * 	g.setNodeFactory( new MyNodeFactory() );
 *  g.addNode("root");
 *  
 *  MyNode n = g.getNode("root");
 *  
 *  for( MyNode node : g.getEachNode() )
 *  {
 *  	// Do something with node
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
