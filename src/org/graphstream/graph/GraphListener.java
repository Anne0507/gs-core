 * Graph change listener.
 * 
 * <p>A graph listener allows to follow each change made to a graph.
 * This listener is able to describe </p>
 * 
 * <p>This listener is in fact the grouping of two specialised listeners.
 * The first one listens only at structural changes in the graph (node and edge
 * addition and removal). It is the {@link org.graphstream.graph.GraphElementsListener}.
 * The second one listens only at attributes values changes on elements of the
 * graph (attribute addition, removal and changement of values). It is the
 * {@link org.graphstream.graph.GraphAttributesListener}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>It is possible to listen only at elements or attributes changes with these
 * two interfaces. Registering a graph listener will allow to listen at the
 * both elements and attributes at the same time.</p>
