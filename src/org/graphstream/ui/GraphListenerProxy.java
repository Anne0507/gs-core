/**
 * Helper class that allows to listen at a graph an either copy it or send events
 * across thread boundaries, for example.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface and its implementations has many usages. It acts as a proxy that allows to put a
 * listener on a graph and manipulate, translate, send these events to other graph listeners.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>The two main implementations of this class are a version that allows to maintain an exact
 * copy of the graph (an "input graph" and an "output graph"), and another that allows to do the
 * same but in addition is able to do this
 * across threads boundaries. This means that the copy of the graph, the output graph,
 * can be in another thread.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class is (or maybe) "passive", you must check that events coming from graph are available
 * regularly by calling the
 * {@link #checkEvents()} method. Indeed, events may be buffered, or need a translation phase,
 * etc. This however is not always the case.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This method will check if some events occurred in the input graph
 * and will modify the output graph accordingly (if any) and forward events to each registered
 * graph listener.
 * </p>
