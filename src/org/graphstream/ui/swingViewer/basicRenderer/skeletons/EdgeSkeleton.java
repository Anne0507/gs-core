	 * 		<li>For the LINE type it is null, nothing is stored,
	 * 			the two end points are given by the edge nodes.</li>
	 * 		<li>For the AUTO_LOOP and AUTO_MULTI types, this contains
	 * 			two "control" points for a cubic curve. The two node
	 * 			centers playing the role of the first and last points.</li>
	 * 		<li>For the POINTS type, the points define line segments. There
	 * 			can be one ore more points.
	 * 			For example if there are one point, this defines two
	 * 			line segments one going from the start node to the point
	 * 			and one going from the point to the end node.</li>
	 * 		<li>For the VECTORS type, the points define a vector
	 * 			shape that contains the first and last end-points
	 * 			(the nodes are not considered). This means that there
	 * 			are at least two points in the set.</li>
