/**
 * A view on a graphic graph.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A view is rendering surface where a {@link GraphRenderer} draws the graphic
 * graph of the {@link Viewer}. The view is no (no more in this version) an
 * AWT component. However you can integrate it in your own GUI using either
 * {@link #getGUIComponent()} (which returns an object, and is agnostic of the
 * GUI toolkit used) or the two methods {@link #isAWT()} and {@link #getAWTComponent()}
 * that works for Swing and AWT views (the default ones). Do not assume that the views
 * use Swing or AWT however, the viewer has a factory for views and can create any
 * kind of views. The default views are AWT/Swing compliant, but there also exist
 * SWT or OpenGL views. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Threads</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As for the {@link Viewer}, the views ALWAYS run in the Swing thread. Some parts
 * of the view interface are made to be used from this thread only, other parts are protected
 * from concurrent accesses. This is documented individually in each method.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You will probably have few occasions to use views in another thread than the Swing
 * one, excepted when creating them. The view provides control on the way the graph is
 * seen using a {@link Camera} object. This object must be used ONLY in the Swing thread,
 * If you are in another thread, use the {@link CameraManager} class to control the view.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>View control</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can setup a {@link MouseManager} and a {@link ShortcutManager} to handle user interaction
 * with the view. By default the {@link DefaultMouseManager} and the {@link DefaultShortcutManager}
 * classes are used. Theses classes are only a mouse listener and a keyboard listener, and they
 * modify the view or camera according to the user interactions.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * You can control a "selection area" that is usually drawn with the mouse in the view. This
 * selection will put a "ui.selected" attribute on each node that lies within the selection
 * area bounds. It is rare to have to use these methods excepted when creating a
 * {@link MouseManager}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition to this, you can put a {@link LayerRenderer} either under the graph rendering or
 * above it. A layer renderer is an object that is called either before or after rendering by the
 * view and is passed a {@link Graphics2D} instance to draw inside the view. You can with this
 * draw whatever you want in addition to the graph. One common use of the back layer renderer is
 * to put another viewer in it to render two graphs one above the other.
 * </p>
