/**
 * Interface for classes that draw a GraphicGraph in an AWT container.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are two rendering mechanisms in this UI package: the viewer and
 * the renderers. The viewer is a complete architecture to create a Swing container (the View)
 * and manage several of them in a "viewer" that handles the animation (calls regularly
 * the views if the graph changed). It handles all the details of opening a window if needed,
 * setting up a graphic graph, and an eventual layout thread. The renderer is in charge of the
 * drawing proper. It renders in a "surface" provided by the view. Separating the viewer and views
 * from the renderers allow to have separate parts of the API handling very different tasks : to
 * the viewer and views the role of handling the swing components, the graphic graph and all the
 * pipelining with GraphStream. To the renderer the role of drawing a graph using whichever
 * rendering technology that can draw in an AWT container.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Therefore, the renderer architecture is a way to only render a graphic graph in any surface,
 * handled directly by the developer. One could also use a renderer without using the {@link Viewer}
 * or the {@link View}s. When using the renderer you must handle the graphic graph by yourself, but
 * you have a lot more flexibility.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A renderer becomes active only after its {@link #open(GraphicGraph, Container)} method has been
 * called. This method specifies the drawing surface it should use (an AWT container) and the
 * graphic graph is draws on this surface. Similarly, when you are done with the renderer, you call
 * the {@link #close()} method to free the surface.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The renderer provides a {@link Camera} object that tells how the graph is viewed. The camera
 * allows to zoom on the graph, pan the view on the graph, rotate the view. It also allows the
 * renderer to know which graph elements are visible, and which are not, allowing to fasten the
 * drawing process when zooming on graphs with a very large number of elements.
 * </p>
