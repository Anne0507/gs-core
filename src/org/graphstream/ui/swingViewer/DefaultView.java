/**
 * Base for constructing views.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This base view is an abstract class that provides mechanisms that are
 * necessary in any view :
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>the painting and repainting mechanism.</li>
 * 		<li>the optional frame handling.</li>
 * 		<li>the frame closing protocol.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This view also handle a current selection of nodes and sprites.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>The painting mechanism</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This mechanism pushes a repaint query each time the viewer asks us to
 * repaint. There are two repaint mechanisms. The first one is the repaints
 * triggered by the Swing event system (each time the panel is moved, resized,
 * etc.). It calls directly repaint() that will in turn call paintComponent().
 * The second is the one triggered by the viewer. The viewer will call
 * {@link #display(GraphicGraph, boolean)} (that only calls repaint()) on a
 * regular basis (by default 25 frames per second), excepted if the graph did not
 * changed, in which case no redrawing is needed, and the CPU cycles can be saved.
 * You are guaranteed that {@link #display(GraphicGraph, boolean)} is called only
 * by the Viewer. This allows to separate the cases where the redraw is triggered
 * by the Swing repaint mechanism, from repaints coming from the animation loop
 * of the Viewer.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The main method to implement is {@link #render(Graphics2D)}. This method is
 * called each time the graph needs to be rendered anew in the canvas.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * All the painting, by default, is deferred to a {@link GraphRenderer}
 * instance. This mechanism allows developers that do not want to mess with the
 * viewer/view mechanisms to render a graph in any Swing surface.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>The optional frame handling</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This abstract view is able to create a frame that is added around this panel
 * (each view is a {@link JPanel} instance). The frame can be removed at any time.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>The frame closing protocol</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This abstract view handles the closing protocol. This means that it will
 * close the view if needed, or only hide it to allow reopening it later.
 * Furthermore it adds the "ui.viewClosed" attribute to the graph when the view
 * is closed or hidden, and removes it when the view is shown. The value of this
 * graph attribute is the identifier of the view.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Threads</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As some methods are protected from concurrent accesses, this view will use the
 * {@link Viewer} instance as the lock. The {@link Viewer} uses itself as a lock
 * for its own synchronized methods.
 * </p>
