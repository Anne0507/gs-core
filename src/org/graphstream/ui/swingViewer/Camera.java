/**

 * The camera is in charge of projecting coordinates in graph units (GU)
 * into user spaces (often in pixels, PX). It defines the transformation (an affine
 * matrix) to pass from the first to the second. It also contains the graph
 * metrics, a set of values that give the overall dimensions of the graph in
 * graph units, as well as the view port, the area on the screen (or any
 * rendering surface) that will receive the results in pixels (or rendering
 * units), and various conversion method to pass from GU to PX and the reverse. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The camera defines a center at which it always points. It can zoom on the
 * graph, pan in any direction and rotate along two axes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Knowing the transformation also allows to provide services like "what element
 * is visible ?" (in the camera view).
