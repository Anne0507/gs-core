/**
 * Define how the graph is viewed, what part is visible, etc.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The camera is in charge of projecting coordinates in graph units (GU)
 * into user spaces (often in pixels, PX). It defines the transformation
 *  to pass from the first to the second. It also contains the graph
 * metrics, a set of values that give the overall dimensions of the graph in
 * graph units, as well as the view port in pixels (the area on the screen (or any
 * rendering surface) that will receive the results in pixels), and various
 * conversion method to pass from GU to PX and the reverse. However the main
 * convertion methods are in this class: {@link #transformGuToPx(Point3)} and
 * {@link #transformPxToGu(Point3)}. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The camera defines a center at which it always points ({@link #getViewCenter()}). This center is
 * at the center of the view (indeed). The camera can then zoom on the graph by specifying the
 * percent of the view visible ({@link #setViewPercent(double)}, this is very comparable to the
 * aperture, the camera is not becoming closer to the center point with the zoom, you can
 * also use the {@link #setGraphViewport(double, double, double, double)} and to remove it us
 * {@link #removeGraphViewport()}). It can also pan
 * in any direction by moving the center point ({@link #setViewCenter(double, double, double)}).
 * Finally, it can also rotate along two axes ({@link #setViewRotation(double)}) in 3D or one axe
 * in 2D.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The camera has two modes: The first is called "auto-fit". In this mode the camera
 * uses the graph bounds to adapt the view so that the whole graph is always visible.
 * The settings of the camera are changed automatically to do this.
 * The other mode is the user mode. It is activated as soon as the user change the view
 * zoom, moves the center, or rotate the view ({@link #setViewCenter(double, double, double)},
 * {@link #setViewPercent(double)}, {@link #setViewRotation(double)}). In this mode the settings
 * of the camera are never automatically changed. Once in user mode, you can switch back to auto-fit
 * mode with {@link #setAutoFitView(boolean)}. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Knowing the transformation also allows to provide services like "what element
 * is visible ?" (in the camera view). The camera plays a great role in determining
 * which element of the view is effectively in view. This allows renderers to process
 * the element to draw faster. If the camera is in auto-fit mode, all elements are always
 * visible. Else, the camera can check witch element are visible and maintains a cache
 * of these elements until the next change in the view or in the graph. See the
 * {@link #isVisible(GraphicElement)} method.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@link #resetView()} method allows to switch back the camera in auto-fit mode and
 * additionally reset all settings to their defaults.
 * </p>
