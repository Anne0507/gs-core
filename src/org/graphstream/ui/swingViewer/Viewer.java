/**
 * Set of views on a graphic graph.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The viewer is an object whose role is to maintain a set of {@link View}s. Each view
 * is a graphical representation of a graph. Each {@link View} owns a specific
 * {@link GraphRenderer} that is in charge of really rendering the graph. Graph
 * renderers can be chosen when adding a view.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Graphic Graph</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The viewer is in charge of maintaining a {@link GraphicGraph}. The graphic graph is
 * a special representation of the graph that defines the visual properties of nodes
 * and edges and adds the notion of sprite. It contains a style sheet and a set of
 * "style groups" that contains {@link GraphicElement}s having the same style.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The graphic graph is updated from the real graph to display by being a sink
 * of this graph. The graphic graph can be created by the viewer or given at construction (to
 * share it with another viewer).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>Threads</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The viewer ALWAYS runs in the Swing thread. Be very careful, the Swing thread
 * is not the thread your application runs at start (called the main thread). When
 * designing a GUI, you often have all your code running from GUI events in the
 * Swing thread, and your real graph is also accessed from this thread and there are
 * no problems. When you are designing a small application that uses no GUI but only
 * calls {@link Graph#display()}, you have two threads, the main thread and the Swing
 * thread where the viewer runs. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The viewer is able to cope with these two threads by interposing a special
 * {@link ProxyPipe} (instance of {@link ThreadProxyPipe}) so that the events from the real graph
 * flow to the graphic graph in a safe way. But you have to tell it to the viewer. By default
 * the viewer assumes your real graph is in the main thread and therefore creates a proxy pipe
 * to protect from concurrent accesses. If you know your application runs in the Swing thread,
 * you can inform the viewer that a proxy pipe is not needed and gain a lot more speed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Most of the methods of the viewer are protected from concurrent accesses, when it makes sense,
 * but not all. This is documented individually in each method. For example the {@link #getGraphicGraph()}
 * will allow you an access to the underlying graphic graph, but this graph is ALWAYS used in
 * the Swing Thread. 
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Animation and rendering loop</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Once created, the viewer runs in a loop inside the Swing thread. The viewer will activate
 * at a given rate to redraw the graph. By default this rate is 25 frames per second. But
 * this can be changed. However the viewer will avoid to repaint the graph is nothing changed
 * either in the view (the camera object did not changed) or in the graph (the graphic
 * graph object was not updated) since the last frame drawn. This mechanism is here to
 * avoid consuming unneeded CPU cycles. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Be very careful: due to the nature of graph events in GraphStream, the viewer
 * is not aware of events that occured on the graph <u>before</u> its creation.
 * There is a special mechanism that replay the graph if you use a proxy pipe or
 * if you pass the graph directly. However, when you create the viewer by yourself
 * and only pass a {@link Source}, the viewer <u>will not</u> display the events
 * that occured on the source before it is connected to it.
 * </p>
