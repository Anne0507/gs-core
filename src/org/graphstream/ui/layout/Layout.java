/**
 * Layout algorithm interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The layout algorithm role is to compute the best possible positions of nodes
 * in a given space (2D or 3D) and eventually break points for edges if
 * supported. As there are many such algorithms with distinct
 * qualities and uses, this interface defines what is awaited from a layout
 * algorithm.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The algorithm can follow a graph by being a {@link org.graphstream.stream.Sink}.
 * However, at the contrary of several other algorithms, it may or not work on the
 * graph itself. It can work on a description of the graph and maintains its own
 * vision of this graph. In return, it may or not modify the graph
 * but instead can send events to listeners telling the new 
 * positions of nodes in the graph. In any case, the layout will also acts as a
 * source for events on the graph (mainly attributes to position nodes and edges).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A layout algorithm is iterative. It continuously updates its internal representation of
 * the graph following a given method and may outputs its computations to a listener
 * for each element of the graph or directly modify the graph. Such a layout algorithm
 * is not made to compute a layout once and for all. This is the best way to
 * handle evolving graphs.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This behavior has been chosen because this algorithm is often run aside the
 * main thread that works on the graph. We want a thread to be able to compute a
 * new layout on its side, without disturbing the main algorithm run on the
 * graph. See the {@link org.graphstream.ui.layout.LayoutRunner} for an
 * helper class allowing to create such a thread.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To be notified of the layout changes dynamically, you may register a
 * {@link LayoutListener} that will be called each time a node changes its
 * position. The layout may or not modify directly the graph. This allows
 * to either put the layout in another thread (in which case a copy of the
 * graph will be done) or to run the layout directly on the main graph.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The graph viewers in the UI package often use a layout algorithm to present
 * graphs on screen.
 * </p>
