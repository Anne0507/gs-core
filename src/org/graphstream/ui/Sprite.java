	/**
	 * Position a sprite in the graph, node or edge space.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The positionning of sprites depends on what it is attached. Two coordinate systems are used.
	 * In cartesian coordinate, the X axis goes positive left to right, the Y axis goes positive
	 * bottom to top and the Z axis goes positive back to front (right-handed). The units are in
	 * "graph space" or "graph units". This means that the measurement used maps the units you
	 * choose when you assign a position to nodes (you can however choose to use pixels or percents
	 * as in graph style sheets).
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If the sprite is not attached the coordinates are in graph space using cartesian coordinates.
	 * In this case, the sprite is positioned somewhere in the space of the graph, like nodes and
	 * edges. This is useful to put an informative label or icon somewhere on the display.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If the sprite is attached to a node, the coordinates express and offset from the node centre
	 * using spherical coordinates. The x value is a radius from the node centre used as origin for
	 * the coordinate system. This radius is given in graph units by default. The y value is a theta
	 * angle that
	 * express a rotation in radians around the cartesian Y axis. The z value is a phi angle that
	 * express a rotation in radians around the cartesian Z axis. Therefore to make a sprite orbit
	 * around a node in two dimensions, you only need to change the x and z coordinates, y has no
	 * meaning.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * If the sprite is attached to an edge, the first coordinate must be in [0..1] and indicates a
	 * percent of the distance between the source and target node of the edge. If the two other
	 * coordinates are zero, the sprite will remain along the edge. Else they express a position on
	 * a plane that is perpendicular to the edge using polar coordinates. That is the edge is the
	 * normal vector of this plane. The y is a radius from a point on the edge defined by the x
	 * coordinate and the z is a theta angle around the axis defined by the edge. In two dimensions
	 * only x and y have a meaning. In this case also, y represents a radius, and can be negative to
	 * put the sprite on a side or another of the edge.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The units parameter allows to specify how lengths are measured. This has no effect on
	 * x when the sprite is attached to an edge or on angles (y and z, angles are always in radians)
	 * when the sprite is attached to a node. For non-attached sprites and for radii, the units
	 * allows to specify how the length must be interpreted (in fixed pixels, in graph units or
	 * in percents of the view width).
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * @param x First coordinate.
	 * @param y Second coordinate.
	 * @param z Third coordinate.
	 * @param units for measuring length.
