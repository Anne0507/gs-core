/**
 * Classes of the graph representation used by the graph viewer.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The graphic graph is a {@link org.graphstream.graph.Graph} implementation
 * that also defines position attributes for its nodes and edges ({@link org.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.GraphicNode}
 * and {@link org.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.GraphicEdge}). It also
 * defines a style sheet and associates with each node and edge a style element
 * according to the style sheet (or a "style" attribute).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition, a sprite manager ({@link org.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.SpriteManager})
 * and {@link org.graphstream.ui.Sprite} implementation
 * ({@link org.graphstream.ui.graphicGraph.GraphicSprite}) is provided. Sprites are
 * visual or textual elements that can be attached to the graph display to visualise
 * data on the graph.
 * </p>
