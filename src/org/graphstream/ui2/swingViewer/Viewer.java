/**
 * Set of views on a graphic graph.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The viewer class is in charge of maintaining :
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>A "graphic graph" (a special graph that internally stores the graph under the form of style
 *      sets of "graphic" elements),</li>
 *	<li>The eventual proxy pipe from which the events come from (but graph events can come from any
 *      kind of source),</li>
 *  <li>A default view, and eventually more views on the graphic graph.</li>
 *  <li>A flag that allows to repaint the view only if the graphic graph changed.<li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The graphic graph can be created by the viewer or given at construction (to share it with another
 * viewer).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Once created, the viewer runs in a loop inside the Swing thread. You cannot call methods on
 * it directly if you are not in this thread. The only operation that you can use in other threads
 * is the constructor, the {@link #addView(View)}, {@link #removeView(String)} and the
 * {@link #close()} methods. Other methods are not protected from concurrent accesses.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some constructors allow a "ProxyPipe" as argument. If given, the graphic graph is made listener
 * of this pipe and the pipe is "pumped" during the view loop. This allows to run algorithms on a
 * graph in the main thread (or any other thread) while letting the viewer run in the swing thread.
 * </p>
