/**
 * Dynamically write the contents of a graph to a file, during the graph
 * lifetime.
 * 
 * <p>
 * At the contrary of the {@link GraphWriterHelper} that output a snapshot of a
 * graph at a given time, this helper will output not only the graph as it is
 * when registered, but all the events that occur during the graph life time.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to do this, it registers a listener in the graph, and each time
 * something is changed in the graph it outputs the corresponding elements in
 * the graph file. The {@link GraphWriterHelper} class only outputs node
 * additions and edge additions. This class at the contrary not only outputs
 * additions, but also node and edges removal and changes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Due to the dynamic nature of this class, you will have to call
 * explicitely the {@link #end()} method to signal the end of the 
 * recording and properly close the open file. f you do not, the
 * file contents may not be completely flushed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This writers implies that the output format is necessarily a format
 * that handles dynamic graphs. You are free to choose the writer, but some of
 * them may not output all the information.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The events registered are all the node/edge addition, deletion and change.
 * The changes are the attribute value changes. It is still possible to use the
 * internal writer to output things while this graph recorder is used. See the
 * {@link #getWriter()} method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Some things do not work well actually:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>It is not possible to delete attributes on edges or node, it is
 *          only possible to change the values. This is a limitation of the
 *          GraphReader and GraphWriter interfaces.</li>
 * 		<li>The I/O exceptions are not reported directly, you have to use
 *          the cumbersome {@link #checkError()} method that returns an
 *          IOException if something occurred during the graph file writing.</li>
 *  </ul>
 * </p>
