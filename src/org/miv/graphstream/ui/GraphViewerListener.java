/**
 * Listener for graph viewer events.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This listeners allows to catch user interactions with graphic graph elements. Most graph viewer
 * implementations allows to select nodes and sprites, and to drag them to modify the layout. This
 * listener role is to report back these events to the program.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that when an automatic layout process is used the automatic movement of nodes is not
 * repported back to the program via this interface. There is a specific mechanism for this
 * (see {@link LayoutListenerProxy}).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * All coordinates given by this listener are in "graph units". This means that the rendering
 * medium units are never used (you never see integer pixels). When you choose to disable the
 * automatic graph layout mechanism, you specify the coordinates of elements by yourself in your
 * own coordinate system. This is this coordinate system that is used to report back click
 * locations. This coordinate system is called "graph units".
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Graph units consider the positive Y axis as going up (and in 3D the positive Z axis goes "out
 * of the screen" a "right-handed" coordinate system). Be careful, as some rendering toolkit like
 * swing consider the Y positive axis to go down (with an origin at the left-top corder of the
 * viewport). In GraphStream, in graph units, the origin can be anywhere in the window and the Y
 * axis goes up.
