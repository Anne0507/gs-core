/**
 * Implementation of the {@link org.miv.graphstream.ui.GraphViewer} using Swing and
 * the Java2D API.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This implementation is the reference implementation. It respects the full style sheet
 * specification and provides a sprite renderer.
 * </p>
 * 
 * TODO: this renderer is not really object-oriented. The rendering of edges and
 *  node should be in the edge and node classes. For edge arrow there should exist
 *  an arrow class, etc. Maybe for the next release...
