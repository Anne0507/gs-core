/**
 * Sink and source of graph events.
 * 
 * <p>A filter is something that can receive graph events and produce graph events as a result
 * or transformation.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Some filters are paired with another filter from synchronisation. Synchronisation happens
 * when an input X pass through a filter F1 that goes to an output Y and when Y serves as
 * input for a filter F2 toward the output X. Clearly there is a synchronisation loop, Y listens
 * at X through F1 and X listens at Y through F2. Such a configuration is dangerous since this
 * can lead to a endless loop of events. To avoid this there exist two mechanisms : the first
 * one is that inputs generate events only if modified for a change. If they are edited but
 * nothing changed (an attribute was set to its same old value) no event is generated. In most
 * cases this avoids synchronisation loops. The other mechanism is to explicitly pair filters
 * that serve to synchronise inputs and outputs. This is done via the unique new method
 * of this filter : {@link #synchronizeWith( GraphListener, Input )}</p>
 * 
 * @see Input
