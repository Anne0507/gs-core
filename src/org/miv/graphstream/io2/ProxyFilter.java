/**
 * Proxy filter.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A proxy is a kind of event buffer that allows to pass a barrier. The barrier can be a thread,
 * or a network for example. A proxy completely decouple the input from the output. The proxy
 * buffers the input events and when possible it sends them to the listeners at the output.
 * In other words, a proxy is indirect, non synchronised and non blocking. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The usual input/output mechanism is synchronised, direct and blocking : when the event occurs,
 * all listeners are called, and we have to wait they finish to process these events to continue
 * and send new events. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * With proxyes, there is a buffer often compared to a mail box. Each event produced as input is
 * buffered and when the output is free to receive these events it can check the mail box and
 * empty it, thus receiving the pending events. This way of doing is completely non synchronised
 * and non blocking (due to the mail box). 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This way of doing allows for example to passe a thread frontier with a minimum of
 * synchronisation : only the mail box has to be synchronised. And the input and output can most
 * of the time run in parallel. Without such a proxy, we would have to synchronise the whole
 * graph, and threads would consume their time waiting one another since most of the work in
 * GraphStream is centred on graphs. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For network, this is the same thing : events are buffered before sending them to the network.
 * When the other end is ready it can check these events in one operation. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>However proxyes have a limitation : they force the receiving end to check for events 
 * regularly. This is however most of the time not a problem since most work on graphs in
 * GraphStream is dynamic and runs iteratively.</p>
