/**
 * An element is a part of a graph (node, edge, the graph itself).
 * 
 * <p>
 * An interface that defines common method to manipulate identifiers and
 * attributes of the elements (graph, nodes and edges) of a graph.
 * </p>
 *  * 
 * <p>
 * Attributes can be any object and are identified by arbitrary strings. Some
 * attributes are stored as numbers or strings and are in this case named
 * number, label or vector. There are utility methods to handle these attributes
 * ({@link #getNumber(String)}, {@link #getLabel(String)}) or
 * {@link #getVector(String)}, however they are  also accessible through the
 * more general method {@link #getAttribute(String)}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Important</h3>
 * <p>
 * Implementing classes should indicate the complexity of their implementation for each method.
 * </p>
