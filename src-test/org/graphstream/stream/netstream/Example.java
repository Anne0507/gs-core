/**
 * A simple example of use of the NetStream sender and receiver.
 * <p>
 * This is a dummy example where the Java Sender and Receiver are used together.
 * This is not the normal use of the NetStream, normally the receiver should be
 * connected to a sender from another language or the opposite. For a
 * java-to-java network communication other tools based on RMI are probably more
 * suitable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In this class a basic receiver plugged to a displayed multigraph is created
 * and waits for events on the "default" stream, on port 2001 at "localhost". In
 * another thread, a Sender is created with a graph connected to its sink, so
 * that any event from the graph will end-up to the sender. The sender connects
 * to "localhost" on port 2001 and sends, on the default stream, any received
 * event to the receiver, through the network, using the NetStream protocol.
 * </p>
